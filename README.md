# Data-Analytics-Projects
Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.
We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:

#### Drop NaN values from DataFrame
#### Removing rows based on a condition
#### Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
### Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. In this section we explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

#### What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
#### What city sold the most product?
#### What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
#### What products are most often sold together?
#### What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
## To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

#### Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
#### Adding columns
#### Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
#### Using the .apply() method
#### Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
#### Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
#### Labeling our graphs
